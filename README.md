# AI Image Generation Program

This repository contains code for an AI image generation program built in Python, based on a project from the YouTube channel [TechWithTim](https://www.youtube.com/c/TechWithTim). I’ve cloned the original repository and made some modifications to the `2-1.py` model code. Follow the instructions below to run the program either in Google Colab or locally on your machine.

## Running in Google Colab

1. Open the Google Colab notebook: [Link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/123ZtMp35m_5ITFdkdJ1aDeakxZHwbf_2?usp=sharing)
2. Change the runtime to use a T4 GPU:
   - Click on `Runtime` in the menu.
   - Select `Change runtime type`.
   - Choose `GPU` and select `T4` from the dropdown.
3. Simply run the code cells in the notebook to generate images.

## Running Locally

To run the program locally, follow these steps:

1. **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install CUDA** (if you have an NVIDIA GPU):
   - Follow the instructions on the [NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) page to install CUDA.

3. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv myenv
   source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `myenv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
   
4. **Install Requirements**:
   - Clone this repository and navigate to the directory:
     ```bash
     git clone <repository-url>
     cd <repository-directory>
     ```
   - Install the required packages:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
5. **Install PyTorch**:
   - Install PyTorch by following the instructions on the [PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). Make sure to select the appropriate options for your system.

6. **Create a Hugging Face Account**:
   - Go to [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) and create an account.

7. **Get a Hugging Face Access Token**:
   - After logging in, go to your account settings and generate an access token.

8. **Run Hugging Face CLI**:
   ```bash
   huggingface-cli login
   ```
   - Paste your access token when prompted.

9. **Request Access to High End Models**
   - Some models require you to accept their license agreements. If you plan to use the newest stable diffusion model, you must accept the license [here](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-3.5-large).

10. **Choose the Script to Run**:
   - You can choose to run either `2-1.py` or `3-5.py`:
     - `2-1.py`: Suitable for most systems (modified version).
     - `3-5.py`: Requires a high-end GPU and takes nearly 50 times longer to run.

### About the Project

This AI Image Generation program uses Stable Diffusion to generate images from text prompts. The project was originally created by *TechWithTim* (YouTube channel) and has been cloned and modified to improve the functionality of the `2-1.py` model.

### Summary of Changes

- I made adjustments to the `2-1.py` model code, which includes adding a GUI using customtkinter to run the 2_1 model so we can give our own prompts and it will generate an image.
